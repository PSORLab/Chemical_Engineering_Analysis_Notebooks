## Overview of Content

This repository contains a series of supplemental notebooks intended for use
in courses centered around application of numerical methods with a chemical engineering
context. This content was originally developed for the junior level, Chemical
Engineering Analysis course at the University of Connecticut.

This original course made use of Dorfman and Daotidis's "Numerical Methods and Chemical Engineering Applications" as a primary textbook. A list of the chapters of Dorfman and Daotidis which correspond to each tutorial is provided below. We should however note that the enclosed material was design to be used in a stand alone fashion and may be readily integrated into other courses.

- Tutorial \#0 (Introduction to Matlab/Julia) - N/A
- Tutorial \#1 (Linear Algebraic Systems) - Chapter 2
- Tutorial \#2 (Nonlinear Algebraic Systems) - Chapter 3
- Tutorial \#3 (ODEs, Initial Value Problems) - Chapter 4
- Tutorial \#4 (ODEs, Boundary Value Problems) - Chapter 6
- Tutorial \#5 (Partial Differential Equations) - Chapter 7
- Tutorial \#6 (Optimization) - N/A
