    "Monochlorobenzene is a high boiling point solvent used in many industrial applications ranging from the manufacture of [dyes](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/76/55/12/31756682f755c5/US6013811.pdf), [plastic and rubber processing](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/66/c8/e1/69918f557fbd35/US8563079.pdf), [paints](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/28/17/a7/a40e46f75806cf/US9062206.pdf), and [waxes](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3999960A/en). Approximately, [$1 billion](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-chlorobenzene-industry-300939916.html) worth of this solvent are used per year. It is [produced by combining chlorine with benzene](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/14356007.o06_o03) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as Ferric Chloride FeCl<sub>3</sub> or Anhydrous Aluminum Chloride AlCl<sub>3</sub>. When benzene and chlorine are mixed two key reactions occur: <b>(1)</b> the chlorination of benzene and <b>(2)</b> the secondary undesirable chlorination of the resulting monochlorobenzene. Product purity is ensured by performing a series of separation steps after the initial reaction and reagant usage is reduced by including a recycle loop. \n",

    "<b>Objective:</b> A large customer order has been placed for monochlorobenzene that needs to be fulfilled on a tight timeline. The small chemical company you work for has occasionally produced this solvent in the past and has an existing 6m<sup>3</sup> continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) that will need to be repurposed to produce 25kmol/h monochlorobenzene. Moreover, there isn't sufficient development time available to attempt to improve the processing conditions for the reactor or separators. As a result, you'll need to use the documented process conditions for the reactor and separators which means supplying to the first separator an effluent consisting of 90% benzene, 7% monochlorobenzene, and 3% dichlorobenzene by mole. We need to determine the recycle flow rates and reaction rates required needed to achieve the desired rate at which monochlorobenzene need to be produced.   \n",

    "While a linear system, `Mx = b`, may have a unique solution, we also seek to understand whether using a particular algorithm to solve `Mx = b` will yeild an accurate solution. We often don't know `M` or `b` exactly. As a consequence, solutions which vary greatly when `M` or `b` are slightly perturbed may be suspect. This is generally assessed by evaluating the **condition number** of a linear system and is defined as: $\\text{cond}(M) \\equiv ||M|| \\times ||M^{-1}||$. A derivation of this is given in section 2.3.4 of Dorfman and Daoutidis, Numerical Methods with Chemical Engineering Applications which arrives at the following inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$||\\Delta x || \\leq \\text{cond}(M)\\bigg(\\frac{|| \\Delta b || || x ||}{|| b ||}\\bigg)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a fixed condition number, $\\text{cond}(M)$, solution $x$, and $b$ if we slightly perturb $b$ by $\\Delta b$ then $x$ may change by at most an amount proportional to the condition number. Another way of interpreting this is by applying the following rule of thumb: the condition number $\\kappa$ means that the method looses $\\log_{10}{\\kappa}$ of accuracy relative to rounding error.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an application leads to an ill-posed problem (values of **M** and **b** may be known to very high precision), there are a multitude of ways this may be dealt with. This most common and often most robust approach is to apply a [**preconditioner**](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~benzi/Web_papers/survey.pdf). That is we find an appropriate matrix **Y** and multiply both sides of the original linear system to create an equivalent new linear system, `(YM)x = (Yb)`, which has a lower condition number. We can then solve the equivalent modified system. "
